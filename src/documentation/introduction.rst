respyabc has been written by Manuel Huth for the courses Effective Programming Practices for Economists and Scientific Comuputing for Economists which are taught within the University of Bonn's Master in Economcis. It builds on the work of respy and pyabc to provide a likelihood-free inference framework to infer parameters from finite-horizon dynamic discrete choice models.

This short introduction projet shows how resypabc can be integrated into an exemplary workflow.
